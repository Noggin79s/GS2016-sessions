**Presenter**: Andreas Dieckow

**Task**: Apply SQL security to multiple servers in a distributed system

**Approach**: Provide code samples for using new API calls to apply SQL security statements to multiple instances of our products
 

Description: The requirement that started at all. See examples on how to use this new feature and integrate it into your application by discuss code examples.

Problem: SQL Security is local to the instance and most of time driven by customer application code. That it is only local to the instance and is not automatically going to other instances requires a solution.

Solution: With application code use new API calls to issue SQL security statements that is applied to multiple instances.
